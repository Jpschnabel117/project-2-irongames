# project-2-irongames
Welcome to the repository for Irongames!

Irongames goal is to provide a platform for past present and future ironhack students to post their first projects (js canvas games), allow them to see others projects, rate them and comment on them. submitted games have to be approved by users with admin credentials before they are visible to the public. an admin only portal allows the editing and permissions of comments and projects submitted.

This platform is built using Javascript, Handlebars, HTML and CSS.
